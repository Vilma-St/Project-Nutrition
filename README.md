QUESTION:
Am I more likely to gain weight if I stick to Spanish or Italian recipes during quarantine?

Data

Scraped by type of cuisine from https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/

Nr. of recipes on the website by type of cuisine:
Spanish 164, Italian 1058, Indian 359, Mexican 157, Greek 137, Moroccan 108, French 428, Japanese 73, Chinese 73, American 233, vegan 246

Work Plan

1. Scrape links to recipes by type of cuisine (Spanish, Italian, etc. ...) from the website 
2. Scrape the ingredients list and table of nutritional values (kcal, proteins, etc.) for each recipe
3. Clean and organise the data in a dataframe, then export to csv file & SQL
5. Perform exploratory analysis
5. Hypothesis testing (try to answer the main question)
6. Score each recipe by the number of vegetables included (the times any vegetable is mentioned)
7. Which cuisine uses more vegetables?
8. Visualise the data in Tableau
9. Presentation
